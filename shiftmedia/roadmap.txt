Provides facility to transfer files to storage backend.
There should be two backends - local folder and AWS
Should not use a database
Should use hashing algorithm to sign file requests to prevent resize abuse
Should use UUID for naming files
    0918209128091280912/ <- storage directory
    0918209128091280912/original.something <- original file
    0918209128091280912/100x100.jpg <- resize file (dynamic or config-based resizes?)

Should scale
Should work over HTTPS
Should Handle video encoding (how to specify desired formats? configured templates?)
For the purpose of accepting missing file redirects and thus resizes,  it has to be a server of some sort.



How to know file extension from id?
It should be contained within file name? Or shall we put it under namespace?
But why do we need to know that?



How to tunnel video to server? How to tunnel all files to server?
This will require sockets and async. As well as authentication.

Download vs open
Will mean setting content-type policy


WORKING WITH STORAGE PATHS

We typically have 2 paths:
    * original
    * resize

Final path is the product of putting file to backend
Final path is essentially object id string OR IS IT?
We should be able to parse that string into a set of parameters
Filename encoding-decoding logic should be probably extracted into helper
This will get used gor building links in userland applications
